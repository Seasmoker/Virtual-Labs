#Virtual Labs Introduction

Virtual Labs, a Ministry of Education project under NMEICT, offers free remote laboratory
learning experiences. Workshops and nodal centers support institute partnerships within the
Virtual Labs consortium. The project, led by IIT Delhi and involving twelve institutes, provides
over 100 Virtual Labs and 700+ web-enabled experiments across various domains using
open-source technologies. These simulations are accessible online without any additional
